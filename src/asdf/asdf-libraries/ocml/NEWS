This is OCML version 7.5.  It is a development branch of OCML.

* Changes since OCML 7.3

** Support for namespaces.

** Language translation

*** Unified KR lanaguage translation interface.

*** New OCML -> OWL translator.

*** New XML and XSD to OCML translators.

** New user manual.

Based on Enrico Motta’s book ‘Reusable Components for Knowledge
Modelling’, IOS Press, ISBN 1-58603-003-5.

** API.

*** New with-ontology and with-ocml-thread-safety macros.

*** Constants use +foo+ naming scheme.

** Configuration and test

*** Test cases.

*** ASDF system definition.

*** Ports.

OCML now works on Lispworks (4 and 5), SBCL (various recent versions),
and Allegro (Express 8.1).

** Bug fixes.

*** Slot types are correctly computed for forward-referenced types.

* Changes in OCML 7.3

** Export from OCML to RDF(S).

Use function TRANSLATE-OCML-ONTOLOGY-TO-RDFS to generate RDF(S) from
OCML.

* Changes in OCML 7.0

** Fully implemented constraint checker.

This verifies that all type and cardinality restrictions are satisfied
by a KB.  In addition it also checks constraint expressions specified
using either :constraint or :iff-def keywords.  These expressions can
be associated with classes, slots or standard relations.

Functions ENABLE-CONSTRAINT-CHECKING and DISABLE-CONSTRAINT-CHECKING
switch constraint checking on and off. By default the mechanism is off.

see file OCML:EXPERIMENTAL;CONSTR_CHECK_EX.LISP for an example of
using the constraint checker.

** Forward chainer gets 

Changes to the forward chainer which allows rules to fire in 'watcher
mode', as soon as assertions trigger them, as well as by explicit
program call (i.e., explicit invocations of function run).

Set *fc-in-watcher-mode* to T to enable 'watcher mode'.

** Export from OCML to Ontolingua.  

Use function TRANSLATE-OCML-ONTOLOGY-TO-ONTOLINGUA to generate an
Ontolingua spec from an OCML ontology.
