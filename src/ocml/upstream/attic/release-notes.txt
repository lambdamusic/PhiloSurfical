New for version 7.0


- Fully implemented constraint checker.  This versifies that
  all type and cardinality restrictions are satisfied by a
  KB.  In addition it also checks constraint expressions specified
  using either :constraint or :iff-def keywords.  These expressions
  can be associated with classes, slots or standard relations.

  Functions ENABLE-CONSTRAINT-CHECKING and DISABLE-CONSTRAINT-CHECKING
  switch constraint checking on and off. By default the mechanism is off.

  see file OCML:EXPERIMENTAL;CONSTR_CHECK_EX.LISP for an example
  of using the constraint checker. 



- Changes to the forward chainer which allows rules 
  to fire in 'watcher mode', as soon as assertions trigger them, 
  as well as  by explicit program call (i.e., explicit invocations of 
  function run).

 set *fc-in-watcher-mode* to T to enable 'watcher mode'



- Export mechanism from OCML to Ontolingua.  Use function 
  TRANSLATE-OCML-ONTOLOGY-TO-ONTOLINGUA to generate an Ontolingua
  spec from an OCML ontology
