# PhiloSurfical

Legacy code for the http://philosurfical.open.ac.uk/ web app, a prototype tool for browsing a philosophical text, taking advantage of a map of the concepts relevant to the text. 

I developed this project as part of my PhD dissertation at the Knowledge Media Institute, Open University, UK. The PhiloSurfical application was a proof of concept so after a while it was taken offline, but the LISP source code is available here under a GPL license.
