# PhiloSurfical

Legacy code for the http://philosurfical.open.ac.uk/ web app, a prototype tool for browsing a philosophical text, taking advantage of a map of the concepts relevant to the text. 

### What is it

PhiloSurfical is an ontology based e-learning application for Wittgenstein's Tractatus (a classic text in philosophy).

I developed this project as part of my PhD dissertation at the Knowledge Media Institute, Open University, UK. The PhiloSurfical application was a proof of concept so after a while it was taken offline, but the LISP source code is available here under a GPL license.

Running this project requires working knowledge of Common Lisp in general, and Lispworks in particular. Please check the project homepage for more info, or feel free to get in touch with me by following the links available my homepage.
